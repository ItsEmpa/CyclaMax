	CyclaMax
</h1>

This is a mod done for highlighting Mooshroom cows in Hypixel Skyblock, specifically the ones in the
Mushroom Desert.

To open the config menu, run `/cyclamax` or `/cm` for short.

This mod needs [SkyHanni](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni) and [NotEnoughUpdate](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates) to work.
